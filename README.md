## 🚀 About Me

I am a software engineer with hands-on experience building **end-to-end web applications**, working across backend, frontend, and system integrations.

I care deeply about:

* Clean and maintainable code
* Software architecture and best practices
* Performance and scalability
* Real-world business logic
* Long-term maintainability

I usually work on **production systems**, dealing with real users, real data, and real constraints.
